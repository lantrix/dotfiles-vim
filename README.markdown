# Lantrix DotFiles - VIM

These are the vim configurations I'm using. Feel free to use by YMMV.

## Fonts

I'm using the new and shiny [Source Code Pro](http://sourceforge.net/projects/sourcecodepro.adobe/). You'll want to download and install that first.

## Using

This is a repo (Castle) compatible with the [homesick gem](https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick).
Assuming you already have installed homesick, and don't have an existing .vimrc and .vim...

    cd ~
    homesick clone lantrix/dotfiles-vim
    homesick symlink dotfiles-vim
